# ColorRecognitionAndTracking

This application recognizes the color red and tracks it by drawing the object's trajectory

### How it works

Capture video frame from webcam
Convert the captured frame from BGR to HSV
Threshold the image
Use the trackbars to optimize HSV settings
Remove noise (small objects and small holes)
Calculate object position
Draw a line from the previous to the current point
